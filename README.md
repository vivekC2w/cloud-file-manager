Project Setup and Run Guide
Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 14 or higher)
npm (Node package manager)
MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
AWS SDK (for S3 integration)

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of your project directory. This file will hold all your environment variables. Hereâ€™s a template for what your .env file might look like:

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGO_URI=mongodb://<username>:<password>@localhost:27017/<database-name>

# AWS S3 Configuration
S3_BUCKET_NAME=<your-s3-bucket-name>
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key-id>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-access-key>
REGION=<your-region>

# OAuth2 Configuration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-google-client-id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-google-client-secret>
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback

# Session Configuration
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret

Explanation of Environment Variables
MONGO_URI: The connection string for your MongoDB database.
S3_BUCKET_NAME: The name of your S3 bucket where files will be stored.
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Your AWS access key ID for authentication.
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Your AWS secret access key for authentication.
AWS_REGION: The AWS region where your S3 bucket is located (e.g., us-east-1).
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: The client ID obtained from the Google Developer Console for OAuth2 authentication.
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: The client secret obtained from the Google Developer Console.
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL: The callback URL for OAuth2, which should match the settings in your Google Developer Console.
SESSION_SECRET: A secret key for session management.


Step 4: Run the Project
After setting up your environment variables, start the server using the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server will start running on http://localhost:3000.

Step 5: Access the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. From there, you can log in using the OAuth2 authentication method provided (Google).

Important Notes
Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and accessible using the provided connection string.
For Google OAuth2, make sure you have configured your OAuth consent screen and added the necessary redirect URIs in your Google Developer Console.

Step 6: Testing API Endpoints
You can use Postman or any API client to test the following endpoints:

Login: GET /auth/login (redirects to Google OAuth)
Google Callback: GET /auth/google/callback (handles authentication)
